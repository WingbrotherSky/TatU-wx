What should I expect for my first tattoo experience?

It is good to be prepared for your first tattoo. First, you should be well rested and well fed. If you are tired, or your blood sugar is
low, you may be more sensitive to discomfort. Drinking alcohol before getting tattooed can cause you to become dehydrated,and
increase bleeding which can affect the quality of the tattoo.

Expect to see blood. The amount varies from person to person, but usually it is about what you would expect from a scraped
knee or rug burn. The level of pain also varies from person to person, but most people find it bearable. The best thing to do is
just accept the discomfort and relax. Fighting or tensing will only increase your discomfort.
If you start to feel faint or a little "green," tell your artist right away instead of toughing it out. There is absolutely nothing
wrongwith taking a break. Your artist is prepared for this sort of thing and knows how to handle it.
If you need to change position or stretch, go to the bathroom, sneeze or wiggle for any reason, let your artist know BEFORE you
do it.

Your new tattoo will get a patch of shiny skin over it or it may scab over. Leave the scab alone! This is a normal part of the healing
process. Picking the scab may lead to infection or damage to your tattoo. The scab will slough off gradually in the course
ofa week or two. If you have any questions during the healing process, call your artist. Don't rely on stories told to you by your
friends.
