How should I choose an artist?

OSDH licenses tattoo artists and establishments, so insure that these licenses are current. Artistic abilities vary, and this element
cannot be licensed. Make every effort to find an artist whose work you like, and who will work on you safely. Ask others where
they got tattooed, and about their experience. At the tattoo establishment, ask to see photographs of the artist's
work,but keep in mind that the pictures may have been taken right after the procedure when redness and swelling are common.
Taking time to check out a few artists and shops will ensure that you are happy with your results.

----------------

At the shop.

Make sure the shop is neat and clean. What you see in the front room is a good indication of the shopâ€™s overall cleanliness. Ask
questions about the shop's safety procedures. What are they doing to insure your health and well-being? The personnel
shouldbe willing and able to answer you questions. If you feel they are brushing your concerns aside or can't answer your questions,leave
and seek out another shop.

----------------

What is single service equipment?

All equipment should be single service if possible. This means that each needle and ink tube set is individually packaged,dated,
sealed and autoclaved. The artist should open a fresh set of needles and ink tubes in front of you. Any ointments,
pigments, needles, gloves, razors, plastic trays or containers used in applying your new tattoo are discarded after use.
