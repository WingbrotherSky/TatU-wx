What should I do after I receive my tattoo to prevent problems?

When finished, your tattoo artist will clean excess ink and body fluids from the tattooed area and then apply an ointment andbandage.
The ointment soothes the skin, keeps it moist, and prevents the bandage from sticking. The bandage protects yourskin
and absorbs drainage.

Ointment: It is important to keep the area moist. Use the ointment recommended by your artist. Antibiotic ointments can cause
allergic reactions, and petroleum jellies are too occlusive. Ointments containing vitamins A and D are recommended bysome
artists.

Bandage: Using plastic wrap will create an environment that can encourage infection. A cotton bandage is recommended, particularly
one with a plastic film surrounding the cotton, so that the drainage can be absorbed but the dressing doesnâ€™t stick to
the skin. Your tattoo artist will tell you how long to wear a bandage.

Post-care instructions: Your tattoo artist should give you specific verbal and printed instructions regarding post-tattoo care. Pay
attention and follow these instructions completely. If you have any questions or problems during the healing process, call your
artist. Don't rely on advice from people outside the tattoo industry.
